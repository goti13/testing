# E-Commerce with GitHub Actions



Capstone Project: E-Commerce Application Cl/ CD Pipeline

Project Overview: Automated Pipeline for an E-Commerce Platform


Hypothetical Use Case:

You are tasked with developing and maintaining an e-commerce platform. This platform has two primary components:


- E-Commerce API: Backend service handling product listings, user accounts, and order processing.

- E-Commerce Frontend: A web application for users to browse products, manage their accounts, and place orders.

The goal is to automate the integration and deployment proces for both components using Gitub Actions, ensuring continuous delivery and integration.

Project Tasks:

Task 1: Project Setup

- Create a new GitHub repository named 'ecommerce-platform'.


- Inside the repository, create two directories: 'api for the backend and "webapp' for the frontend.


Task 2: Initialize GitHub Actions


-  Initialize a Git repository and add your initial project structure.

-  Create ' github/workflows* directory in your repository for GitHub Actions.

Task 3: Backend API Setup

- In the 'api directory, set up a simple Node.js/Express application that handles basic e-commerce operations.

- Implement unit tests for your AP!.

Task 4: Frontend Web Application Setup

- In the webapp' directory, create a simple React application that interacts with the backend API.

-  Ensure the frontend has basic features like product listing, user login, and order placement.

Task 5: Continuous Integration Workflow

- Write a GitHub Actions workflow for the backend and frontend that:

- Installs dependencies.

- Runs tests.

- Builds the application

Task 6: Docker Integration

- Create Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend

- Modify your GitHub Actions workflows to build Docker images.


Task 7: Deploy to Cloud

- Choose a cloud platform for deployment (AWS, Azure, or GCP).

- Configure GitHub Actions to deploy the Docker images to the chosen cloud platform.

-  Use GitHub Secrets to securely store and access cloud credentials.

Task 8: Continuous Deployment

-  Configure your workflows to deploy updates automatically to the cloud environment when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Task 9: Performance and Security

- Implement caching in your workflows to optimize build times.

- Ensure all sensitive data, including API kevs and database credentials, are secured using GitHub Secrets
Task 10: Project Documentation

- Document your project setup, workflow details, and instructions for local development in a README. md fle.

Phase 1: Initial Setup

Step 1.1: Create Project Structure

```
mkdir ecommerce-platform
cd ecommerce-platform

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create the complete directory structure
mkdir -p .github/workflows api webapp/src webapp/public aws/scripts

# Verify structure
find . -type f

```

Step 1.2: Create Essential Files

```
# Create .gitignore
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# Dependencies
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*

# Production builds
webapp/build/
dist/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local

# Logs
*.log

# Coverage
coverage/

# OS files
.DS_Store

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
EOF

```

Phase 2: Backend Implementation


Step 2.1: Setup Backend

```
# Navigate to api directory
cd api

# Initialize package.json
npm init -y

# Install dependencies
npm install express cors helmet dotenv express-rate-limit
npm install --save-dev jest supertest nodemon

```

Step 2.2: Create Backend Files

api/server.js file:
